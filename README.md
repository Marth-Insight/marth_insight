Data Visualization of the Planetary weather data


Is Mars similar to the Earth or are they different brothers of the same parent? Find out how the climate varies using Data Visualization and comparisons to draw insights, similar or different.


Create an app that displays the temperature of Mars and Earth . Find out how the climate varies using Data Visualization of the Planetary weather data  and compare it with Earths Data to identify the pattern, and use positioning data to show gravity at any location. You also could add information about the GOCE mission or other missions, and extend the capabilities to include magnetic field data from the SWARM mission.
